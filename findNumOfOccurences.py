'''Implement a method to find the number of occurrences of any given word in a book. A word is represented as a string and a book is represented as an array / list of strings.
Optimize the method to be called multiple times.

Book: [" The", "dog", "jumped", "in", "the", "dog", "house" ...]
Word: "dog"  â†’  Occurrences: 2
'''

book = [" The", "dog", "jumped", "in", "the", "dog", "house"]
word = "dog"

# U
# Does spaces in the word matters
# Does lower case upper case matter
# what if input is null
# does space matters or time constraint

# M
# simple for loop to check the word in list T = O(N) S= O(1)

#using dictionary to keep travh of counter as value if key is aready in the dictionary than count++


# P
#initializing dictionary : words to their counts
# create a dictionary 

# loop through array
#   check if current word is in dictionary 
#     if it is 
#       increase counter by 1
#.     else
#       put it in dict
